<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE SOUL
OF MAN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chief advantage that would
result from the establishment of Socialism is, undoubtedly, the
fact that Socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity
of living for others which, in the present condition of things,
presses so hardly upon almost everybody.&nbsp; In fact, scarcely
anyone at all escapes.</p>
<p>Now and then, in the course of the century, a great man of
science, like Darwin; a great poet, like Keats; a fine critical
spirit, like M. Renan; a supreme artist, like Flaubert, has been
able to isolate himself, to keep himself out of reach of the
clamorous claims of others, to stand &lsquo;under the shelter of
the wall,&rsquo; as Plato puts it, <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>and so to realise the perfection of
what was in him, to his own incomparable gain, and to the
incomparable and lasting gain of the whole world.&nbsp; These,
however, are exceptions.&nbsp; The majority of people spoil their
lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism&mdash;are forced,
indeed, so to spoil them.&nbsp; They find themselves surrounded
by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous
starvation.&nbsp; It is inevitable that they should be strongly
moved by all this.&nbsp; The emotions of man are stirred more
quickly than man&rsquo;s intelligence; and, as I pointed out some
time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much
more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have
sympathy with thought.&nbsp; Accordingly, with admirable, though
misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very
sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils
that they see.&nbsp; But their remedies do not <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>cure the
disease: they merely prolong it.&nbsp; Indeed, their remedies are
part of the disease.</p>
<p>They try to solve the problem of poverty, for instance, by
keeping the poor alive; or, in the case of a very advanced
school, by amusing the poor.</p>
<p>But this is not a solution: it is an aggravation of the
difficulty.&nbsp; The proper aim is to try and reconstruct
society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible.&nbsp;
And the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out
of this aim.&nbsp; Just as the worst slave-owners were those who
were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the
system being realised by those who suffered from it, and
understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state
of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people
who try to do most good; and at last we have had the spectacle of
men who have really studied the problem <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>and know the life&mdash;educated men
who live in the East End&mdash;coming forward and imploring the
community to restrain its altruistic impulses of charity,
benevolence, and the like.&nbsp; They do so on the ground that
such charity degrades and demoralises.&nbsp; They are perfectly
right.&nbsp; Charity creates a multitude of sins.</p>
<p>There is also this to be said.&nbsp; It is immoral to use
private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that
result from the institution of private property.&nbsp; It is both
immoral and unfair.</p>
<p>Under Socialism all this will, of course, be altered.&nbsp;
There will be no people living in fetid dens and fetid rags, and
bringing up unhealthy, hunger-pinched children in the midst of
impossible and absolutely repulsive surroundings.&nbsp; The
security of society will not depend, as it does now, on the state
of the weather.&nbsp; If a frost comes we shall not have a
hundred <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>thousand men out of work, tramping about the streets in a
state of disgusting misery, or whining to their neighbours for
alms, or crowding round the doors of loathsome shelters to try
and secure a hunch of bread and a night&rsquo;s unclean
lodging.&nbsp; Each member of the society will share in the
general prosperity and happiness of the society, and if a frost
comes no one will practically be anything the worse.</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply
because it will lead to Individualism.</p>
<p>Socialism, Communism, or whatever one chooses to call it, by
converting private property into public wealth, and substituting
co-operation for competition, will restore society to its proper
condition of a thoroughly healthy organism, and insure the
material well-being of each member of the community.&nbsp; It
will, in fact, give Life its proper basis and its proper <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>environment.&nbsp; But for the full development of Life
to its highest mode of perfection, something more is
needed.&nbsp; What is needed is Individualism.&nbsp; If the
Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with
economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a
word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of
man will be worse than the first.&nbsp; At present, in
consequence of the existence of private property, a great many
people are enabled to develop a certain very limited amount of
Individualism.&nbsp; They are either under no necessity to work
for their living, or are enabled to choose the sphere of activity
that is really congenial to them, and gives them pleasure.&nbsp;
These are the poets, the philosophers, the men of science, the
men of culture&mdash;in a word, the real men, the men who have
realised themselves, and in whom all Humanity gains a partial <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>realisation.&nbsp; Upon the other hand, there are a great
many people who, having no private property of their own, and
being always on the brink of sheer starvation, are compelled to
do the work of beasts of burden, to do work that is quite
uncongenial to them, and to which they are forced by the
peremptory, unreasonable, degrading Tyranny of want.&nbsp; These
are the poor, and amongst them there is no grace of manner, or
charm of speech, or civilisation, or culture, or refinement in
pleasures, or joy of life.&nbsp; From their collective force
Humanity gains much in material prosperity.&nbsp; But it is only
the material result that it gains, and the man who is poor is in
himself absolutely of no importance.&nbsp; He is merely the
infinitesimal atom of a force that, so far from regarding him,
crushes him: indeed, prefers him crushed, as in that case he is
far more obedient.</p>
<p>Of course, it might be said that the <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Individualism generated under
conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule,
of a fine or wonderful type, and that the poor, if they have not
culture and charm, have still many virtues.&nbsp; Both these
statements would be quite true.&nbsp; The possession of private
property is very often extremely demoralising, and that is, of
course, one of the reasons why Socialism wants to get rid of the
institution.&nbsp; In fact, property is really a nuisance.&nbsp;
Some years ago people went about the country saying that property
has duties.&nbsp; They said it so often and so tediously that, at
last, the Church has begun to say it.&nbsp; One hears it now from
every pulpit.&nbsp; It is perfectly true.&nbsp; Property not
merely has duties, but has so many duties that its possession to
any large extent is a bore.&nbsp; It involves endless claims upon
one, endless attention to business, endless bother.&nbsp; If
property had simply pleasures, we could stand <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>it; but its
duties make it unbearable.&nbsp; In the interest of the rich we
must get rid of it.&nbsp; The virtues of the poor may be readily
admitted, and are much to be regretted.&nbsp; We are often told
that the poor are grateful for charity.&nbsp; Some of them are,
no doubt, but the best amongst the poor are never grateful.&nbsp;
They are ungrateful, discontented, disobedient, and
rebellious.&nbsp; They are quite right to be so.&nbsp; Charity
they feel to be a ridiculously inadequate mode of partial
restitution, or a sentimental dole, usually accompanied by some
impertinent attempt on the part of the sentimentalist to
tyrannise over their private lives.&nbsp; Why should they be
grateful for the crumbs that fall from the rich man&rsquo;s
table?&nbsp; They should be seated at the board, and are
beginning to know it.&nbsp; As for being discontented, a man who
would not be discontented with such surroundings and such a low
mode of life would be a perfect brute.&nbsp; Disobedience, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>in the eyes
of anyone who has read history, is man&rsquo;s original
virtue.&nbsp; It is through disobedience that progress has been
made, through disobedience and through rebellion.&nbsp; Sometimes
the poor are praised for being thrifty.&nbsp; But to recommend
thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting.&nbsp; It is
like advising a man who is starving to eat less.&nbsp; For a town
or country labourer to practise thrift would be absolutely
immoral.&nbsp; Man should not be ready to show that he can live
like a badly-fed animal.&nbsp; He should decline to live like
that, and should either steal or go on the rates, which is
considered by many to be a form of stealing.&nbsp; As for
begging, it is safer to beg than to take, but it is finer to take
than to beg.&nbsp; No: a poor man who is ungrateful, unthrifty,
discontented, and rebellious, is probably a real personality, and
has much in him.&nbsp; He is at any rate a healthy protest.&nbsp;
As for the virtuous <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>poor, one can pity them, of course, but one cannot
possibly admire them.&nbsp; They have made private terms with the
enemy, and sold their birthright for very bad pottage.&nbsp; They
must also be extraordinarily stupid.&nbsp; I can quite understand
a man accepting laws that protect private property, and admit of
its accumulation, as long as he himself is able under those
conditions to realise some form of beautiful and intellectual
life.&nbsp; But it is almost incredible to me how a man whose
life is marred and made hideous by such laws can possibly
acquiesce in their continuance.</p>
<p>However, the explanation is not really difficult to
find.&nbsp; It is simply this.&nbsp; Misery and poverty are so
absolutely degrading, and exercise such a paralysing effect over
the nature of men, that no class is ever really conscious of its
own suffering.&nbsp; They have to be told of it by other people,
and they often entirely disbelieve them.&nbsp; <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>What is said
by great employers of labour against agitators is unquestionably
true.&nbsp; Agitators are a set of interfering, meddling people,
who come down to some perfectly contented class of the community,
and sow the seeds of discontent amongst them.&nbsp; That is the
reason why agitators are so absolutely necessary.&nbsp; Without
them, in our incomplete state, there would be no advance towards
civilisation.&nbsp; Slavery was put down in America, not in
consequence of any action on the part of the slaves, or even any
express desire on their part that they should be free.&nbsp; It
was put down entirely through the grossly illegal conduct of
certain agitators in Boston and elsewhere, who were not slaves
themselves, nor owners of slaves, nor had anything to do with the
question really.&nbsp; It was, undoubtedly, the Abolitionists who
set the torch alight, who began the whole thing.&nbsp; And it is
curious to <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>note that from the slaves themselves they received, not
merely very little assistance, but hardly any sympathy even; and
when at the close of the war the slaves found themselves free,
found themselves indeed so absolutely free that they were free to
starve, many of them bitterly regretted the new state of
things.&nbsp; To the thinker, the most tragic fact in the whole
of the French Revolution is not that Marie Antoinette was killed
for being a queen, but that the starved peasant of the
Vend&eacute;e voluntarily went out to die for the hideous cause
of feudalism.</p>
<p>It is clear, then, that no Authoritarian Socialism will
do.&nbsp; For while under the present system a very large number
of people can lead lives of a certain amount of freedom and
expression and happiness, under an industrial-barrack system, or
a system of economic tyranny, nobody would be able to have any
such freedom <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>at all.&nbsp; It is to be regretted that a portion of
our community should be practically in slavery, but to propose to
solve the problem by enslaving the entire community is
childish.&nbsp; Every man must be left quite free to choose his
own work.&nbsp; No form of compulsion must be exercised over
him.&nbsp; If there is, his work will not be good for him, will
not be good in itself, and will not be good for others.&nbsp; And
by work I simply mean activity of any kind.</p>
<p>I hardly think that any Socialist, nowadays, would seriously
propose that an inspector should call every morning at each house
to see that each citizen rose up and did manual labour for eight
hours.&nbsp; Humanity has got beyond that stage, and reserves
such a form of life for the people whom, in a very arbitrary
manner, it chooses to call criminals.&nbsp; But I confess that
many of the socialistic views that I have come across <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>seem to me to
be tainted with ideas of authority, if not of actual
compulsion.&nbsp; Of course, authority and compulsion are out of
the question.&nbsp; All association must be quite
voluntary.&nbsp; It is only in voluntary associations that man is
fine.</p>
<p>But it may be asked how Individualism, which is now more or
less dependent on the existence of private property for its
development, will benefit by the abolition of such private
property.&nbsp; The answer is very simple.&nbsp; It is true that,
under existing conditions, a few men who have had private means
of their own, such as Byron, Shelley, Browning, Victor Hugo,
Baudelaire, and others, have been able to realise their
personality more or less completely.&nbsp; Not one of these men
ever did a single day&rsquo;s work for hire.&nbsp; They were
relieved from poverty.&nbsp; They had an immense advantage.&nbsp;
The question is whether it would be for the good of Individualism
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>that such
an advantage should be taken away.&nbsp; Let us suppose that it
is taken away.&nbsp; What happens then to Individualism?&nbsp;
How will it benefit?</p>
<p>It will benefit in this way.&nbsp; Under the new conditions
Individualism will be far freer, far finer, and far more
intensified than it is now.&nbsp; I am not talking of the great
imaginatively-realised Individualism of such poets as I have
mentioned, but of the great actual Individualism latent and
potential in mankind generally.&nbsp; For the recognition of
private property has really harmed Individualism, and obscured
it, by confusing a man with what he possesses.&nbsp; It has led
Individualism entirely astray.&nbsp; It has made gain not growth
its aim.&nbsp; So that man thought that the important thing was
to have, and did not know that the important thing is to
be.&nbsp; The true perfection of man lies, not in what man has,
but in what man is.&nbsp; <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Private property has crushed true
Individualism, and set up an Individualism that is false.&nbsp;
It has debarred one part of the community from being individual
by starving them.&nbsp; It has debarred the other part of the
community from being individual by putting them on the wrong
road, and encumbering them.&nbsp; Indeed, so completely has
man&rsquo;s personality been absorbed by his possessions that the
English law has always treated offences against a man&rsquo;s
property with far more severity than offences against his person,
and property is still the test of complete citizenship.&nbsp; The
industry necessary for the making money is also very
demoralising.&nbsp; In a community like ours, where property
confers immense distinction, social position, honour, respect,
titles, and other pleasant things of the kind, man, being
naturally ambitious, makes it his aim to accumulate this
property, and goes on wearily and tediously <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>accumulating
it long after he has got far more than he wants, or can use, or
enjoy, or perhaps even know of.&nbsp; Man will kill himself by
overwork in order to secure property, and really, considering the
enormous advantages that property brings, one is hardly
surprised.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s regret is that society should be
constructed on such a basis that man has been forced into a
groove in which he cannot freely develop what is wonderful, and
fascinating, and delightful in him&mdash;in which, in fact, he
misses the true pleasure and joy of living.&nbsp; He is also,
under existing conditions, very insecure.&nbsp; An enormously
wealthy merchant may be&mdash;often is&mdash;at every moment of
his life at the mercy of things that are not under his
control.&nbsp; If the wind blows an extra point or so, or the
weather suddenly changes, or some trivial thing happens, his ship
may go down, his speculations may go wrong, and he finds himself
a poor <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>man, with his social position quite gone.&nbsp; Now,
nothing should be able to harm a man except himself.&nbsp;
Nothing should be able to rob a man at all.&nbsp; What a man
really has, is what is in him.&nbsp; What is outside of him
should be a matter of no importance.</p>
<p>With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have
true, beautiful, healthy Individualism.&nbsp; Nobody will waste
his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for
things.&nbsp; One will live.&nbsp; To live is the rarest thing in
the world.&nbsp; Most people exist, that is all.</p>
<p>It is a question whether we have ever seen the full expression
of a personality, except on the imaginative plane of art.&nbsp;
In action, we never have.&nbsp; C&aelig;sar, says Mommsen, was
the complete and perfect man.&nbsp; But how tragically insecure
was C&aelig;sar!&nbsp; Wherever there is a man who exercises
authority, there is a man who resists authority.&nbsp;
C&aelig;sar was very perfect, <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>but his perfection travelled by too
dangerous a road.&nbsp; Marcus Aurelius was the perfect man, says
Renan.&nbsp; Yes; the great emperor was a perfect man.&nbsp; But
how intolerable were the endless claims upon him!&nbsp; He
staggered under the burden of the empire.&nbsp; He was conscious
how inadequate one man was to bear the weight of that Titan and
too vast orb.&nbsp; What I mean by a perfect man is one who
develops under perfect conditions; one who is not wounded, or
worried or maimed, or in danger.&nbsp; Most personalities have
been obliged to be rebels.&nbsp; Half their strength has been
wasted in friction.&nbsp; Byron&rsquo;s personality, for
instance, was terribly wasted in its battle with the stupidity,
and hypocrisy, and Philistinism of the English.&nbsp; Such
battles do not always intensify strength: they often exaggerate
weakness.&nbsp; Byron was never able to give us what he might
have given us.&nbsp; Shelley escaped better.&nbsp; Like Byron, he
got out of <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>England as soon as possible.&nbsp; But he was not so
well known.&nbsp; If the English had had any idea of what a great
poet he really was, they would have fallen on him with tooth and
nail, and made his life as unbearable to him as they possibly
could.&nbsp; But he was not a remarkable figure in society, and
consequently he escaped, to a certain degree.&nbsp; Still, even
in Shelley the note of rebellion is sometimes too strong.&nbsp;
The note of the perfect personality is not rebellion, but
peace.</p>
<p>It will be a marvellous thing&mdash;the true personality of
man&mdash;when we see it.&nbsp; It will grow naturally and
simply, flowerlike, or as a tree grows.&nbsp; It will not be at
discord.&nbsp; It will never argue or dispute.&nbsp; It will not
prove things.&nbsp; It will know everything.&nbsp; And yet it
will not busy itself about knowledge.&nbsp; It will have
wisdom.&nbsp; Its value will not be measured by material
things.&nbsp; It will have nothing.&nbsp; And yet it will have
everything, and whatever <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>one takes from it, it will still
have, so rich will it be.&nbsp; It will not be always meddling
with others, or asking them to be like itself.&nbsp; It will love
them because they will be different.&nbsp; And yet while it will
not meddle with others, it will help all, as a beautiful thing
helps us, by being what it is.&nbsp; The personality of man will
be very wonderful.&nbsp; It will be as wonderful as the
personality of a child.</p>
<p>In its development it will be assisted by Christianity, if men
desire that; but if men do not desire that, it will develop none
the less surely.&nbsp; For it will not worry itself about the
past, nor care whether things happened or did not happen.&nbsp;
Nor will it admit any laws but its own laws; nor any authority
but its own authority.&nbsp; Yet it will love those who sought to
intensify it, and speak often of them.&nbsp; And of these Christ
was one.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&lsquo;Know thyself&rsquo; was written over the portal
of the antique world.&nbsp; Over the portal of the new world,
&lsquo;Be thyself&rsquo; shall be written.&nbsp; And the message
of Christ to man was simply &lsquo;Be thyself.&rsquo;&nbsp; That
is the secret of Christ.</p>
<p>When Jesus talks about the poor he simply means personalities,
just as when he talks about the rich he simply means people who
have not developed their personalities.&nbsp; Jesus moved in a
community that allowed the accumulation of private property just
as ours does, and the gospel that he preached was not that in
such a community it is an advantage for a man to live on scanty,
unwholesome food, to wear ragged, unwholesome clothes, to sleep
in horrid, unwholesome dwellings, and a disadvantage for a man to
live under healthy, pleasant, and decent conditions.&nbsp; Such a
view would have been wrong there and then, and would, of course,
be still <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>more wrong now and in England; for as man moves
northward the material necessities of life become of more vital
importance, and our society is infinitely more complex, and
displays far greater extremes of luxury and pauperism than any
society of the antique world.&nbsp; What Jesus meant, was
this.&nbsp; He said to man, &lsquo;You have a wonderful
personality.&nbsp; Develop it.&nbsp; Be yourself.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t imagine that your perfection lies in accumulating or
possessing external things.&nbsp; Your affection is inside of
you.&nbsp; If only you could realise that, you would not want to
be rich.&nbsp; Ordinary riches can be stolen from a man.&nbsp;
Real riches cannot.&nbsp; In the treasury-house of your soul,
there are infinitely precious things, that may not be taken from
you.&nbsp; And so, try to so shape your life that external things
will not harm you.&nbsp; And try also to get rid of personal
property.&nbsp; It involves sordid preoccupation, endless
industry, continual wrong.&nbsp; Personal <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>property
hinders Individualism at every step.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is to be
noted that Jesus never says that impoverished people are
necessarily good, or wealthy people necessarily bad.&nbsp; That
would not have been true.&nbsp; Wealthy people are, as a class,
better than impoverished people, more moral, more intellectual,
more well-behaved.&nbsp; There is only one class in the community
that thinks more about money than the rich, and that is the
poor.&nbsp; The poor can think of nothing else.&nbsp; That is the
misery of being poor.&nbsp; What Jesus does say is that man
reaches his perfection, not through what he has, not even through
what he does, but entirely through what he is.&nbsp; And so the
wealthy young man who comes to Jesus is represented as a
thoroughly good citizen, who has broken none of the laws of his
state, none of the commandments of his religion.&nbsp; He is
quite respectable, in the ordinary sense of that extraordinary
word.&nbsp; Jesus says <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>to him, &lsquo;You should give up
private property.&nbsp; It hinders you from realising your
perfection.&nbsp; It is a drag upon you.&nbsp; It is a
burden.&nbsp; Your personality does not need it.&nbsp; It is
within you, and not outside of you, that you will find what you
really are, and what you really want.&rsquo;&nbsp; To his own
friends he says the same thing.&nbsp; He tells them to be
themselves, and not to be always worrying about other
things.&nbsp; What do other things matter?&nbsp; Man is complete
in himself.&nbsp; When they go into the world, the world will
disagree with them.&nbsp; That is inevitable.&nbsp; The world
hates Individualism.&nbsp; But that is not to trouble them.&nbsp;
They are to be calm and self-centred.&nbsp; If a man takes their
cloak, they are to give him their coat, just to show that
material things are of no importance.&nbsp; If people abuse them,
they are not to answer back.&nbsp; What does it signify?&nbsp;
The things people say of a man do not alter a man.&nbsp; He is
what he is.&nbsp; <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Public opinion is of no value whatsoever.&nbsp; Even if
people employ actual violence, they are not to be violent in
turn.&nbsp; That would be to fall to the same low level.&nbsp;
After all, even in prison, a man can be quite free.&nbsp; His
soul can be free.&nbsp; His personality can be untroubled.&nbsp;
He can be at peace.&nbsp; And, above all things, they are not to
interfere with other people or judge them in any way.&nbsp;
Personality is a very mysterious thing.&nbsp; A man cannot always
be estimated by what he does.&nbsp; He may keep the law, and yet
be worthless.&nbsp; He may break the law, and yet be fine.&nbsp;
He may be bad, without ever doing anything bad.&nbsp; He may
commit a sin against society, and yet realise through that sin
his true perfection.</p>
<p>There was a woman who was taken in adultery.&nbsp; We are not
told the history of her love, but that love must have been very
great; for Jesus said that her sins were forgiven her, <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>not because
she repented, but because her love was so intense and
wonderful.&nbsp; Later on, a short time before his death, as he
sat at a feast, the woman came in and poured costly perfumes on
his hair.&nbsp; His friends tried to interfere with her, and said
that it was an extravagance, and that the money that the perfume
cost should have been expended on charitable relief of people in
want, or something of that kind.&nbsp; Jesus did not accept that
view.&nbsp; He pointed out that the material needs of Man were
great and very permanent, but that the spiritual needs of Man
were greater still, and that in one divine moment, and by
selecting its own mode of expression, a personality might make
itself perfect.&nbsp; The world worships the woman, even now, as
a saint.</p>
<p>Yes; there are suggestive things in Individualism.&nbsp;
Socialism annihilates family life, for instance.&nbsp; With the
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>abolition
of private property, marriage in its present form must
disappear.&nbsp; This is part of the programme.&nbsp;
Individualism accepts this and makes it fine.&nbsp; It converts
the abolition of legal restraint into a form of freedom that will
help the full development of personality, and make the love of
man and woman more wonderful, more beautiful, and more
ennobling.&nbsp; Jesus knew this.&nbsp; He rejected the claims of
family life, although they existed in his day and community in a
very marked form.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who is my mother?&nbsp; Who are my
brothers?&rsquo; he said, when he was told that they wished to
speak to him.&nbsp; When one of his followers asked leave to go
and bury his father, &lsquo;Let the dead bury the dead,&rsquo;
was his terrible answer.&nbsp; He would allow no claim whatsoever
to be made on personality.</p>
<p>And so he who would lead a Christlike life is he who is
perfectly and absolutely himself.&nbsp; He may be a <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>great poet,
or a great man of science; or a young student at a University, or
one who watches sheep upon a moor; or a maker of dramas, like
Shakespeare, or a thinker about God, like Spinoza; or a child who
plays in a garden, or a fisherman who throws his net into the
sea.&nbsp; It does not matter what he is, as long as he realises
the perfection of the soul that is within him.&nbsp; All
imitation in morals and in life is wrong.&nbsp; Through the
streets of Jerusalem at the present day crawls one who is mad and
carries a wooden cross on his shoulders.&nbsp; He is a symbol of
the lives that are marred by imitation.&nbsp; Father Damien was
Christlike when he went out to live with the lepers, because in
such service he realised fully what was best in him.&nbsp; But he
was not more Christlike than Wagner when he realised his soul in
music; or than Shelley, when he realised his soul in song.&nbsp;
There is no one type for man.&nbsp; <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>There are as many perfections as
there are imperfect men.&nbsp; And while to the claims of charity
a man may yield and yet be free, to the claims of conformity no
man may yield and remain free at all.</p>
<p>Individualism, then, is what through Socialism we are to
attain to.&nbsp; As a natural result the State must give up all
idea of government.&nbsp; It must give it up because, as a wise
man once said many centuries before Christ, there is such a thing
as leaving mankind alone; there is no such thing as governing
mankind.&nbsp; All modes of government are failures.&nbsp;
Despotism is unjust to everybody, including the despot, who was
probably made for better things.&nbsp; Oligarchies are unjust to
the many, and ochlocracies are unjust to the few.&nbsp; High
hopes were once formed of democracy; but democracy means simply
the bludgeoning of the people by the people for the people.&nbsp;
It has been found out.&nbsp; I must say <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>that it was
high time, for all authority is quite degrading.&nbsp; It
degrades those who exercise it, and degrades those over whom it
is exercised.&nbsp; When it is violently, grossly, and cruelly
used, it produces a good effect, by creating, or at any rate
bringing out, the spirit of revolt and Individualism that is to
kill it.&nbsp; When it is used with a certain amount of kindness,
and accompanied by prizes and rewards, it is dreadfully
demoralising.&nbsp; People, in that case, are less conscious of
the horrible pressure that is being put on them, and so go
through their lives in a sort of coarse comfort, like petted
animals, without ever realising that they are probably thinking
other people&rsquo;s thoughts, living by other people&rsquo;s
standards, wearing practically what one may call other
people&rsquo;s second-hand clothes, and never being themselves
for a single moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;He who would be free,&rsquo;
says a fine thinker, &lsquo;must not conform.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
authority, <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>by bribing people to conform, produces a very gross kind
of over-fed barbarism amongst us.</p>
<p>With authority, punishment will pass away.&nbsp; This will be
a great gain&mdash;a gain, in fact, of incalculable value.&nbsp;
As one reads history, not in the expurgated editions written for
school-boys and passmen, but in the original authorities of each
time, one is absolutely sickened, not by the crimes that the
wicked have committed, but by the punishments that the good have
inflicted; and a community is infinitely more brutalised by the
habitual employment of punishment, than it is by the occurrence
of crime.&nbsp; It obviously follows that the more punishment is
inflicted the more crime is produced, and most modern legislation
has clearly recognised this, and has made it its task to diminish
punishment as far as it thinks it can.&nbsp; Wherever it has
really diminished it, the results have always been extremely <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>good.&nbsp;
The less punishment, the less crime.&nbsp; When there is no
punishment at all, crime will either cease to exist, or, if it
occurs, will be treated by physicians as a very distressing form
of dementia, to be cured by care and kindness.&nbsp; For what are
called criminals nowadays are not criminals at all.&nbsp;
Starvation, and not sin, is the parent of modern crime.&nbsp;
That indeed is the reason why our criminals are, as a class, so
absolutely uninteresting from any psychological point of
view.&nbsp; They are not marvellous Macbeths and terrible
Vautrins.&nbsp; They are merely what ordinary, respectable,
commonplace people would be if they had not got enough to
eat.&nbsp; When private property is abolished there will be no
necessity for crime, no demand for it; it will cease to
exist.&nbsp; Of course, all crimes are not crimes against
property, though such are the crimes that the English law,
valuing what a man has more than what a <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>man is,
punishes with the harshest and most horrible severity, if we
except the crime of murder, and regard death as worse than penal
servitude, a point on which our criminals, I believe,
disagree.&nbsp; But though a crime may not be against property,
it may spring from the misery and rage and depression produced by
our wrong system of property-holding, and so, when that system is
abolished, will disappear.&nbsp; When each member of the
community has sufficient for his wants, and is not interfered
with by his neighbour, it will not be an object of any interest
to him to interfere with anyone else.&nbsp; Jealousy, which is an
extraordinary source of crime in modern life, is an emotion
closely bound up with our conceptions of property, and under
Socialism and Individualism will die out.&nbsp; It is remarkable
that in communistic tribes jealousy is entirely unknown.</p>
<p>Now as the State is not to govern, <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>it may be asked what the State is to
do.&nbsp; The State is to be a voluntary association that will
organise labour, and be the manufacturer and distributor of
necessary commodities.&nbsp; The State is to make what is
useful.&nbsp; The individual is to make what is beautiful.&nbsp;
And as I have mentioned the word labour, I cannot help saying
that a great deal of nonsense is being written and talked
nowadays about the dignity of manual labour.&nbsp; There is
nothing necessarily dignified about manual labour at all, and
most of it is absolutely degrading.&nbsp; It is mentally and
morally injurious to man to do anything in which he does not find
pleasure, and many forms of labour are quite pleasureless
activities, and should be regarded as such.&nbsp; To sweep a
slushy crossing for eight hours, on a day when the east wind is
blowing is a disgusting occupation.&nbsp; To sweep it with
mental, moral, or physical dignity seems to <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>me to be
impossible.&nbsp; To sweep it with joy would be appalling.&nbsp;
Man is made for something better than disturbing dirt.&nbsp; All
work of that kind should be done by a machine.</p>
<p>And I have no doubt that it will be so.&nbsp; Up to the
present, man has been, to a certain extent, the slave of
machinery, and there is something tragic in the fact that as soon
as man had invented a machine to do his work he began to
starve.&nbsp; This, however, is, of course, the result of our
property system and our system of competition.&nbsp; One man owns
a machine which does the work of five hundred men.&nbsp; Five
hundred men are, in consequence, thrown out of employment, and,
having no work to do, become hungry and take to thieving.&nbsp;
The one man secures the produce of the machine and keeps it, and
has five hundred times as much as he should have, and probably,
which is of much more importance, a great <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>deal more
than he really wants.&nbsp; Were that machine the property of
all, every one would benefit by it.&nbsp; It would be an immense
advantage to the community.&nbsp; All unintellectual labour, all
monotonous, dull labour, all labour that deals with dreadful
things, and involves unpleasant conditions, must be done by
machinery.&nbsp; Machinery must work for us in coal mines, and do
all sanitary services, and be the stoker of steamers, and clean
the streets, and run messages on wet days, and do anything that
is tedious or distressing.&nbsp; At present machinery competes
against man.&nbsp; Under proper conditions machinery will serve
man.&nbsp; There is no doubt at all that this is the future of
machinery, and just as trees grow while the country gentleman is
asleep, so while Humanity will be amusing itself, or enjoying
cultivated leisure&mdash;which, and not labour, is the aim of
man&mdash;or making beautiful things, or reading beautiful <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>things, or
simply contemplating the world with admiration and delight,
machinery will be doing all the necessary and unpleasant
work.&nbsp; The fact is, that civilisation requires slaves.&nbsp;
The Greeks were quite right there.&nbsp; Unless there are slaves
to do the ugly, horrible, uninteresting work, culture and
contemplation become almost impossible.&nbsp; Human slavery is
wrong, insecure, and demoralising.&nbsp; On mechanical slavery,
on the slavery of the machine, the future of the world
depends.&nbsp; And when scientific men are no longer called upon
to go down to a depressing East End and distribute bad cocoa and
worse blankets to starving people, they will have delightful
leisure in which to devise wonderful and marvellous things for
their own joy and the joy of everyone else.&nbsp; There will be
great storages of force for every city, and for every house if
required, and this force man will convert into heat, <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>light, or
motion, according to his needs.&nbsp; Is this Utopian?&nbsp; A
map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even
glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity
is always landing.&nbsp; And when Humanity lands there, it looks
out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail.&nbsp; Progress is
the realisation of Utopias.</p>
<p>Now, I have said that the community by means of organisation
of machinery will supply the useful things, and that the
beautiful things will be made by the individual.&nbsp; This is
not merely necessary, but it is the only possible way by which we
can get either the one or the other.&nbsp; An individual who has
to make things for the use of others, and with reference to their
wants and their wishes, does not work with interest, and
consequently cannot put into his work what is best in him.&nbsp;
Upon the other hand, whenever a community or a <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>powerful
section of a community, or a government of any kind, attempts to
dictate to the artist what he is to do, Art either entirely
vanishes, or becomes stereotyped, or degenerates into a low and
ignoble form of craft.&nbsp; A work of art is the unique result
of a unique temperament.&nbsp; Its beauty comes from the fact
that the author is what he is.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with
the fact that other people want what they want.&nbsp; Indeed, the
moment that an artist takes notice of what other people want, and
tries to supply the demand, he ceases to be an artist, and
becomes a dull or an amusing craftsman, an honest or a dishonest
tradesman.&nbsp; He has no further claim to be considered as an
artist.&nbsp; Art is the most intense mode of Individualism that
the world has known.&nbsp; I am inclined to say that it is the
only real mode of Individualism that the world has known.&nbsp;
Crime, which, under certain conditions, may seem <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>to have
created Individualism, must take cognisance of other people and
interfere with them.&nbsp; It belongs to the sphere of
action.&nbsp; But alone, without any reference to his neighbours,
without any interference, the artist can fashion a beautiful
thing; and if he does not do it solely for his own pleasure, he
is not an artist at all.</p>
<p>And it is to be noted that it is the fact that Art is this
intense form of Individualism that makes the public try to
exercise over it in an authority that is as immoral as it is
ridiculous, and as corrupting as it is contemptible.&nbsp; It is
not quite their fault.&nbsp; The public has always, and in every
age, been badly brought up.&nbsp; They are continually asking Art
to be popular, to please their want of taste, to flatter their
absurd vanity, to tell them what they have been told before, to
show them what they ought to be tired of seeing, to amuse them
when they feel heavy after eating too much, and to distract <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>their
thoughts when they are wearied of their own stupidity.&nbsp; Now
Art should never try to be popular.&nbsp; The public should try
to make itself artistic.&nbsp; There is a very wide
difference.&nbsp; If a man of science were told that the results
of his experiments, and the conclusions that he arrived at,
should be of such a character that they would not upset the
received popular notions on the subject, or disturb popular
prejudice, or hurt the sensibilities of people who knew nothing
about science; if a philosopher were told that he had a perfect
right to speculate in the highest spheres of thought, provided
that he arrived at the same conclusions as were held by those who
had never thought in any sphere at all&mdash;well, nowadays the
man of science and the philosopher would be considerably
amused.&nbsp; Yet it is really a very few years since both
philosophy and science were subjected to brutal popular control,
to authority in fact&mdash;<a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the authority of either the general
ignorance of the community, or the terror and greed for power of
an ecclesiastical or governmental class.&nbsp; Of course, we have
to a very great extent got rid of any attempt on the part of the
community, or the Church, or the Government, to interfere with
the individualism of speculative thought, but the attempt to
interfere with the individualism of imaginative art still
lingers.&nbsp; In fact, it does more than linger; it is
aggressive, offensive, and brutalising.</p>
<p>In England, the arts that have escaped best are the <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>arts in which
the public take no interest.&nbsp; Poetry is an instance of what
I mean.&nbsp; We have been able to have fine poetry in England
because the public do not read it, and consequently do not
influence it.&nbsp; The public like to insult poets because they
are individual, but once they have insulted them, they leave them
alone.&nbsp; In the case of the novel and the drama, arts in
which the public do take an interest, the result of the exercise
of popular authority has been absolutely ridiculous.&nbsp; No
country produces such badly-written fiction, such tedious, common
work in the novel form, such silly, vulgar plays as
England.&nbsp; It must necessarily be so.&nbsp; The popular
standard is of such a character that no artist can get to
it.&nbsp; It is at once too easy and too difficult to be a
popular novelist.&nbsp; It is too easy, because the requirements
of the public as far as plot, style, psychology, treatment of
life, and treatment of literature are concerned are within the
reach of the very meanest capacity and the most uncultivated
mind.&nbsp; It is too difficult, because to meet such
requirements the artist would have to do violence to his
temperament, would have to write not for the artistic joy of
writing, but for the amusement of half-educated people, and so
would have to suppress his individualism, <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>forget his
culture, annihilate his style, and surrender everything that is
valuable in him.&nbsp; In the case of the drama, things are a
little better: the theatre-going public like the obvious, it is
true, but they do not like the tedious; and burlesque and
farcical comedy, the two most popular forms, are distinct forms
of art.&nbsp; Delightful work may be produced under burlesque and
farcical conditions, and in work of this kind the artist in
England is allowed very great freedom.&nbsp; It is when one comes
to the higher forms of the drama that the result of popular
control is seen.&nbsp; The one thing that the public dislike is
novelty.&nbsp; Any attempt to extend the subject-matter of art is
extremely distasteful to the public; and yet the vitality and
progress of art depend in a large measure on the continual
extension of subject-matter.&nbsp; The public dislike novelty
because they are afraid of it.&nbsp; It represents to them a mode
of Individualism, an assertion <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>on the part of the artist that he
selects his own subject, and treats it as he chooses.&nbsp; The
public are quite right in their attitude.&nbsp; Art is
Individualism, and Individualism is a disturbing and
disintegrating force.&nbsp; Therein lies its immense value.&nbsp;
For what it seeks to disturb is monotony of type, slavery of
custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level
of a machine.&nbsp; In Art, the public accept what has been,
because they cannot alter it, not because they appreciate
it.&nbsp; They swallow their classics whole, and never taste
them.&nbsp; They endure them as the inevitable, and as they
cannot mar them, they mouth about them.&nbsp; Strangely enough,
or not strangely, according to one&rsquo;s own views, this
acceptance of the classics does a great deal of harm.&nbsp; The
uncritical admiration of the Bible and Shakespeare in England is
an instance of what I mean.&nbsp; With regard to the Bible,
considerations of ecclesiastical <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>authority enter into the matter, so
that I need not dwell upon the point.</p>
<p>But in the case of Shakespeare it is quite obvious that the
public really see neither the beauties nor the defects of his
plays.&nbsp; If they saw the beauties, they would not object to
the development of the drama; and if they saw the defects, they
would not object to the development of the drama either.&nbsp;
The fact is, the public make use of the classics of a country as
a means of checking the progress of Art.&nbsp; They degrade the
classics into authorities.&nbsp; They use them as bludgeons for
preventing the free expression of Beauty in new forms.&nbsp; They
are always asking a writer why he does not write like somebody
else, or a painter why he does not paint like somebody else,
quite oblivious of the fact that if either of them did anything
of the kind he would cease to be an artist.&nbsp; A fresh mode of
Beauty is absolutely distasteful to them, and whenever it appears
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>they get
so angry, and bewildered that they always use two stupid
expressions&mdash;one is that the work of art is grossly
unintelligible; the other, that the work of art is grossly
immoral.&nbsp; What they mean by these words seems to me to be
this.&nbsp; When they say a work is grossly unintelligible, they
mean that the artist has said or made a beautiful thing that is
new; when they describe a work as grossly immoral, they mean that
the artist has said or made a beautiful thing that is true.&nbsp;
The former expression has reference to style; the latter to
subject-matter.&nbsp; But they probably use the words very
vaguely, as an ordinary mob will use ready-made
paving-stones.&nbsp; There is not a single real poet or
prose-writer of this century, for instance, on whom the British
public have not solemnly conferred diplomas of immorality, and
these diplomas practically take the place, with us, of what in
France, is the formal recognition of an Academy <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>of Letters,
and fortunately make the establishment of such an institution
quite unnecessary in England.&nbsp; Of course, the public are
very reckless in their use of the word.&nbsp; That they should
have called Wordsworth an immoral poet, was only to be
expected.&nbsp; Wordsworth was a poet.&nbsp; But that they should
have called Charles Kingsley an immoral novelist is
extraordinary.&nbsp; Kingsley&rsquo;s prose was not of a very
fine quality.&nbsp; Still, there is the word, and they use it as
best they can.&nbsp; An artist is, of course, not disturbed by
it.&nbsp; The true artist is a man who believes absolutely in
himself, because he is absolutely himself.&nbsp; But I can fancy
that if an artist produced a work of art in England that
immediately on its appearance was recognised by the public,
through their medium, which is the public press, as a work that
was quite intelligible and highly moral, he would begin to
seriously question whether in its creation <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>he had really
been himself at all, and consequently whether the work was not
quite unworthy of him, and either of a thoroughly second-rate
order, or of no artistic value whatsoever.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, I have wronged the public in limiting them
to such words as &lsquo;immoral,&rsquo;
&lsquo;unintelligible,&rsquo; &lsquo;exotic,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;unhealthy.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is one other word that they
use.&nbsp; That word is &lsquo;morbid.&rsquo;&nbsp; They do not
use it often.&nbsp; The meaning of the word is so simple that
they are afraid of using it.&nbsp; Still, they use it sometimes,
and, now and then, one comes across it in popular
newspapers.&nbsp; It is, of course, a ridiculous word to apply to
a work of art.&nbsp; For what is morbidity but a mood of emotion
or a mode of thought that one cannot express?&nbsp; The public
are all morbid, because the public can never find expression for
anything.&nbsp; The artist is never morbid.&nbsp; He expresses
everything.&nbsp; He stands outside his subject, and through its
<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>medium
produces incomparable and artistic effects.&nbsp; To call an
artist morbid because he deals with morbidity as his
subject-matter is as silly as if one called Shakespeare mad
because he wrote &lsquo;King Lear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the whole, an artist in England gains something by being
attacked.&nbsp; His individuality is intensified.&nbsp; He
becomes more completely himself.&nbsp; Of course, the attacks are
very gross, very impertinent, and very contemptible.&nbsp; But
then no artist expects grace from the vulgar mind, or style from
the suburban intellect.&nbsp; Vulgarity and stupidity are two
very vivid facts in modern life.&nbsp; One regrets them,
naturally.&nbsp; But there they are.&nbsp; They are subjects for
study, like everything else.&nbsp; And it is only fair to state,
with regard to modern journalists, that they always apologise to
one in private for what they have written against one in
public.</p>
<p>Within the last few years two other <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>adjectives, it may be mentioned, have
been added to the very limited vocabulary of art-abuse that is at
the disposal of the public.&nbsp; One is the word
&lsquo;unhealthy,&rsquo; the other is the word
&lsquo;exotic.&rsquo;&nbsp; The latter merely expresses the rage
of the momentary mushroom against the immortal, entrancing, and
exquisitely lovely orchid.&nbsp; It is a tribute, but a tribute
of no importance.&nbsp; The word &lsquo;unhealthy,&rsquo;
however, admits of analysis.&nbsp; It is a rather interesting
word.&nbsp; In fact, it is so interesting that the people who use
it do not know what it means.</p>
<p>What does it mean?&nbsp; What is a healthy, or an unhealthy
work of art?&nbsp; All terms that one applies to a work of art,
provided that one applies them rationally, have reference to
either its style or its subject, or to both together.&nbsp; From
the point of view of style, a healthy work of art is one whose
style recognises the beauty of the material it employs, be that
material one of words <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>or of bronze, of colour or of ivory,
and uses that beauty as a factor in producing the &aelig;sthetic
effect.&nbsp; From the point of view of subject, a healthy work
of art is one the choice of whose subject is conditioned by the
temperament of the artist, and comes directly out of it.&nbsp; In
fine, a healthy work of art is one that has both perfection and
personality.&nbsp; Of course, form and substance cannot be
separated in a work of art; they are always one.&nbsp; But for
purposes of analysis, and setting the wholeness of &aelig;sthetic
impression aside for a moment, we can intellectually so separate
them.&nbsp; An unhealthy work of art, on the other hand, is a
work whose style is obvious, old-fashioned, and common, and whose
subject is deliberately chosen, not because the artist has any
pleasure in it, but because he thinks that the public will pay
him for it.&nbsp; In fact, the popular novel that the public
calls healthy is always a thoroughly unhealthy production; <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>and what the
public call an unhealthy novel is always a beautiful and healthy
work of art.</p>
<p>I need hardly say that I am not, for a single moment,
complaining that the public and the public press misuse these
words.&nbsp; I do not see how, with their lack of comprehension
of what Art is, they could possibly use them in the proper
sense.&nbsp; I am merely pointing out the misuse; and as for the
origin of the misuse and the meaning that lies behind it all, the
explanation is very simple.&nbsp; It comes from the barbarous
conception of authority.&nbsp; It comes from the natural
inability of a community corrupted by authority to understand or
appreciate Individualism.&nbsp; In a word, it comes from that
monstrous and ignorant thing that is called Public Opinion,
which, bad and well-meaning as it is when it tries to control
action, is infamous and of evil meaning when it tries to control
Thought or Art.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>Indeed,
there is much more to be said in favour of the physical force of
the public than there is in favour of the public&rsquo;s
opinion.&nbsp; The former may be fine.&nbsp; The latter must be
foolish.&nbsp; It is often said that force is no argument.&nbsp;
That, however, entirely depends on what one wants to prove.&nbsp;
Many of the most important problems of the last few centuries,
such as the continuance of personal government in England, or of
feudalism in France, have been solved entirely by means of
physical force.&nbsp; The very violence of a revolution may make
the public grand and splendid for a moment.&nbsp; It was a fatal
day when the public discovered that the pen is mightier than the
paving-stone, and can be made as offensive as the brickbat.&nbsp;
They at once sought for the journalist, found him, developed him,
and made him their industrious and well-paid servant.&nbsp; It is
greatly to be regretted, for both their sakes.&nbsp; <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Behind the
barricade there may be much that is noble and heroic.&nbsp; But
what is there behind the leading-article but prejudice,
stupidity, cant, and twaddle?&nbsp; And when these four are
joined together they make a terrible force, and constitute the
new authority.</p>
<p>In old days men had the rack.&nbsp; Now they have the
press.&nbsp; That is an improvement certainly.&nbsp; But still it
is very bad, and wrong, and demoralising.&nbsp;
Somebody&mdash;was it Burke?&mdash;called journalism the fourth
estate.&nbsp; That was true at the time, no doubt.&nbsp; But at
the present moment it really is the only estate.&nbsp; It has
eaten up the other three.&nbsp; The Lords Temporal say nothing,
the Lords Spiritual have nothing to say, and the House of Commons
has nothing to say and says it.&nbsp; We are dominated by
Journalism.&nbsp; In America the President reigns for four years,
and Journalism governs for ever and ever.&nbsp; Fortunately <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>in America
Journalism has carried its authority to the grossest and most
brutal extreme.&nbsp; As a natural consequence it has begun to
create a spirit of revolt.&nbsp; People are amused by it, or
disgusted by it, according to their temperaments.&nbsp; But it is
no longer the real force it was.&nbsp; It is not seriously
treated.&nbsp; In England, Journalism, not, except in a few
well-known instances, having been carried to such excesses of
brutality, is still a great factor, a really remarkable
power.&nbsp; The tyranny that it proposes to exercise over
people&rsquo;s private lives seems to me to be quite
extraordinary.&nbsp; The fact is, that the public have an
insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth
knowing.&nbsp; Journalism, conscious of this, and having
tradesman-like habits, supplies their demands.&nbsp; In centuries
before ours the public nailed the ears of journalists to the
pump.&nbsp; That was quite hideous.&nbsp; In this century
journalists have nailed their <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>own ears to the keyhole.&nbsp; That
is much worse.&nbsp; And what aggravates the mischief is that the
journalists who are most to blame are not the amusing journalists
who write for what are called Society papers.&nbsp; The harm is
done by the serious, thoughtful, earnest journalists, who
solemnly, as they are doing at present, will drag before the eyes
of the public some incident in the private life of a great
statesman, of a man who is a leader of political thought as he is
a creator of political force, and invite the public to discuss
the incident, to exercise authority in the matter, to give their
views, and not merely to give their views, but to carry them into
action, to dictate to the man upon all other points, to dictate
to his party, to dictate to his country; in fact, to make
themselves ridiculous, offensive, and harmful.&nbsp; The private
lives of men and women should not be told to the public.&nbsp;
The public have nothing to <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>do with them at all.&nbsp; In France
they manage these things better.&nbsp; There they do not allow
the details of the trials that take place in the divorce courts
to be published for the amusement or criticism of the
public.&nbsp; All that the public are allowed to know is that the
divorce has taken place and was granted on petition of one or
other or both of the married parties concerned.&nbsp; In France,
in fact, they limit the journalist, and allow the artist almost
perfect freedom.&nbsp; Here we allow absolute freedom to the
journalist, and entirely limit the artist.&nbsp; English public
opinion, that is to say, tries to constrain and impede and warp
the man who makes things that are beautiful in effect, and
compels the journalist to retail things that are ugly, or
disgusting, or revolting in fact, so that we have the most
serious journalists in the world, and the most indecent
newspapers.&nbsp; It is no exaggeration to talk of
compulsion.&nbsp; There <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>are possibly some journalists who
take a real pleasure in publishing horrible things, or who, being
poor, look to scandals as forming a sort of permanent basis for
an income.&nbsp; But there are other journalists, I feel certain,
men of education and cultivation, who really dislike publishing
these things, who know that it is wrong to do so, and only do it
because the unhealthy conditions under which their occupation is
carried on oblige them to supply the public with what the public
wants, and to compete with other journalists in making that
supply as full and satisfying to the gross popular appetite as
possible.&nbsp; It is a very degrading position for any body of
educated men to be placed in, and I have no doubt that most of
them feel it acutely.</p>
<p>However, let us leave what is really a very sordid side of the
subject, and return to the question of popular control in the
matter of Art, by which <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>I mean Public Opinion dictating to
the artist the form which he is to use, the mode in which he is
to use it, and the materials with which he is to work.&nbsp; I
have pointed out that the arts which have escaped best in England
are the arts in which the public have not been interested.&nbsp;
They are, however, interested in the drama, and as a certain
advance has been made in the drama within the last ten or fifteen
years, it is important to point out that this advance is entirely
due to a few individual artists refusing to accept the popular
want of taste as their standard, and refusing to regard Art as a
mere matter of demand and supply.&nbsp; With his marvellous and
vivid personality, with a style that has really a true
colour-element in it, with his extraordinary power, not over mere
mimicry but over imaginative and intellectual creation, Mr
Irving, had his sole object been to give the public what they
wanted, could have produced <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>the commonest plays in the commonest
manner, and made as much success and money as a man could
possibly desire.&nbsp; But his object was not that.&nbsp; His
object was to realise his own perfection as an artist, under
certain conditions, and in certain forms of Art.&nbsp; At first
he appealed to the few: now he has educated the many.&nbsp; He
has created in the public both taste and temperament.&nbsp; The
public appreciate his artistic success immensely.&nbsp; I often
wonder, however, whether the public understand that that success
is entirely due to the fact that he did not accept their
standard, but realised his own.&nbsp; With their standard the
Lyceum would have been a sort of second-rate booth, as some of
the popular theatres in London are at present.&nbsp; Whether they
understand it or not the fact however remains, that taste and
temperament have, to a certain extent been created in the public,
and that <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>the public is capable of developing these
qualities.&nbsp; The problem then is, why do not the public
become more civilised?&nbsp; They have the capacity.&nbsp; What
stops them?</p>
<p>The thing that stops them, it must be said again, is their
desire to exercise authority over the artist and over works of
art.&nbsp; To certain theatres, such as the Lyceum and the
Haymarket, the public seem to come in a proper mood.&nbsp; In
both of these theatres there have been individual artists, who
have succeeded in creating in their audiences&mdash;and every
theatre in London has its own audience&mdash;the temperament to
which Art appeals.&nbsp; And what is that temperament?&nbsp; It
is the temperament of receptivity.&nbsp; That is all.</p>
<p>If a man approaches a work of art with any desire to exercise
authority over it and the artist, he approaches it in such a
spirit that he cannot receive any artistic impression from it at
all.&nbsp; The work of art is to dominate <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>the
spectator: the spectator is not to dominate the work of
art.&nbsp; The spectator is to be receptive.&nbsp; He is to be
the violin on which the master is to play.&nbsp; And the more
completely he can suppress his own silly views, his own foolish
prejudices, his own absurd ideas of what Art should be, or should
not be, the more likely he is to understand and appreciate the
work of art in question.&nbsp; This is, of course, quite obvious
in the case of the vulgar theatre-going public of English men and
women.&nbsp; But it is equally true of what are called educated
people.&nbsp; For an educated person&rsquo;s ideas of Art are
drawn naturally from what Art has been, whereas the new work of
art is beautiful by being what Art has never been; and to measure
it by the standard of the past is to measure it by a standard on
the rejection of which its real perfection depends.&nbsp; A
temperament capable of receiving, through an imaginative medium,
and under imaginative <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>conditions, new and beautiful
impressions, is the only temperament that can appreciate a work
of art.&nbsp; And true as this is in the case of the appreciation
of sculpture and painting, it is still more true of the
appreciation of such arts as the drama.&nbsp; For a picture and a
statue are not at war with Time.&nbsp; They take no count of its
succession.&nbsp; In one moment their unity may be
apprehended.&nbsp; In the case of literature it is
different.&nbsp; Time must be traversed before the unity of
effect is realised.&nbsp; And so, in the drama, there may occur
in the first act of the play something whose real artistic value
may not be evident to the spectator till the third or fourth act
is reached.&nbsp; Is the silly fellow to get angry and call out,
and disturb the play, and annoy the artists?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The
honest man is to sit quietly, and know the delightful emotions of
wonder, curiosity, and suspense.&nbsp; He is not to go to the
play to lose a vulgar <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>temper.&nbsp; He is to go to the play
to realise an artistic temperament.&nbsp; He is to go to the play
to gain an artistic temperament.&nbsp; He is not the arbiter of
the work of art.&nbsp; He is one who is admitted to contemplate
the work of art, and, if the work be fine, to forget in its
contemplation and the egotism that mars him&mdash;the egotism of
his ignorance, or the egotism of his information.&nbsp; This
point about the drama is hardly, I think, sufficiently
recognised.&nbsp; I can quite understand that were
&lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo; produced for the first time before a modern
London audience, many of the people present would strongly and
vigorously object to the introduction of the witches in the first
act, with their grotesque phrases and their ridiculous
words.&nbsp; But when the play is over one realises that the
laughter of the witches in &lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo; is as terrible
as the laughter of madness in &lsquo;Lear,&rsquo; more terrible
than the laughter of Iago in the tragedy of the <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Moor.&nbsp;
No spectator of art needs a more perfect mood of receptivity than
the spectator of a play.&nbsp; The moment he seeks to exercise
authority he becomes the avowed enemy of Art and of
himself.&nbsp; Art does not mind.&nbsp; It is he who suffers.</p>
<p>With the novel it is the same thing.&nbsp; Popular authority
and the recognition of popular authority are fatal.&nbsp;
Thackeray&rsquo;s &lsquo;Esmond&rsquo; is a beautiful work of art
because he wrote it to please himself.&nbsp; In his other novels,
in &lsquo;Pendennis,&rsquo; in &lsquo;Philip,&rsquo; in
&lsquo;Vanity Fair&rsquo; even, at times, he is too conscious of
the public, and spoils his work by appealing directly to the
sympathies of the public, or by directly mocking at them.&nbsp; A
true artist takes no notice whatever of the public.&nbsp; The
public are to him non-existent.&nbsp; He has no poppied or
honeyed cakes through which to give the monster sleep or
sustenance.&nbsp; He leaves that to the popular novelist.&nbsp;
One incomparable novelist we have <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>now in England, Mr George
Meredith.&nbsp; There are better artists in France, but France
has no one whose view of life is so large, so varied, so
imaginatively true.&nbsp; There are tellers of stories in Russia
who have a more vivid sense of what pain in fiction may be.&nbsp;
But to him belongs philosophy in fiction.&nbsp; His people not
merely live, but they live in thought.&nbsp; One can see them
from myriad points of view.&nbsp; They are suggestive.&nbsp;
There is soul in them and around them.&nbsp; They are
interpretative and symbolic.&nbsp; And he who made them, those
wonderful quickly-moving figures, made them for his own pleasure,
and has never asked the public what they wanted, has never cared
to know what they wanted, has never allowed the public to dictate
to him or influence him in any way but has gone on intensifying
his own personality, and producing his own individual work.&nbsp;
At first none came to him.&nbsp; That did not matter.&nbsp; Then
the few came to <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>him.&nbsp; That did not change him.&nbsp; The many have
come now.&nbsp; He is still the same.&nbsp; He is an incomparable
novelist.</p>
<p>With the decorative arts it is not different.&nbsp; The public
clung with really pathetic tenacity to what I believe were the
direct traditions of the Great Exhibition of international
vulgarity, traditions that were so appalling that the houses in
which people lived were only fit for blind people to live
in.&nbsp; Beautiful things began to be made, beautiful colours
came from the dyer&rsquo;s hand, beautiful patterns from the
artist&rsquo;s brain, and the use of beautiful things and their
value and importance were set forth.&nbsp; The public were really
very indignant.&nbsp; They lost their temper.&nbsp; They said
silly things.&nbsp; No one minded.&nbsp; No one was a whit the
worse.&nbsp; No one accepted the authority of public
opinion.&nbsp; And now it is almost impossible to enter any
modern house without seeing some recognition of good taste, some
recognition of the value of lovely surroundings, <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>some sign of
appreciation of beauty.&nbsp; In fact, people&rsquo;s houses are,
as a rule, quite charming nowadays.&nbsp; People have been to a
very great extent civilised.&nbsp; It is only fair to state,
however, that the extraordinary success of the revolution in
house-decoration and furniture and the like has not really been
due to the majority of the public developing a very fine taste in
such matters.&nbsp; It has been chiefly due to the fact that the
craftsmen of things so appreciated the pleasure of making what
was beautiful, and woke to such a vivid consciousness of the
hideousness and vulgarity of what the public had previously
wanted, that they simply starved the public out.&nbsp; It would
be quite impossible at the present moment to furnish a room as
rooms were furnished a few years ago, without going for
everything to an auction of second-hand furniture from some
third-rate lodging-house.&nbsp; The things are no longer
made.&nbsp; However they <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>may object to it, people must
nowadays have something charming in their surroundings.&nbsp;
Fortunately for them, their assumption of authority in these
art-matters came to entire grief.</p>
<p>It is evident, then, that all authority in such things is
bad.&nbsp; People sometimes inquire what form of government is
most suitable for an artist to live under.&nbsp; To this question
there is only one answer.&nbsp; The form of government that is
most suitable to the artist is no government at all.&nbsp;
Authority over him and his art is ridiculous.&nbsp; It has been
stated that under despotisms artists have produced lovely
work.&nbsp; This is not quite so.&nbsp; Artists have visited
despots, not as subjects to be tyrannised over, but as wandering
wonder-makers, as fascinating vagrant personalities, to be
entertained and charmed and suffered to be at peace, and allowed
to create.&nbsp; There is this to be said in favour of the
despot, that he, being an individual, <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>may have culture, while the mob,
being a monster, has none.&nbsp; One who is an Emperor and King
may stoop down to pick up a brush for a painter, but when the
democracy stoops down it is merely to throw mud.&nbsp; And yet
the democracy have not so far to stoop as the emperor.&nbsp; In
fact, when they want to throw mud they have not to stoop at
all.&nbsp; But there is no necessity to separate the monarch from
the mob; all authority is equally bad.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of despots.&nbsp; There is the despot
who tyrannises over the body.&nbsp; There is the despot who
tyrannises over the soul.&nbsp; There is the despot who
tyrannises over the soul and body alike.&nbsp; The first is
called the Prince.&nbsp; The second is called the Pope.&nbsp; The
third is called the People.&nbsp; The Prince may be
cultivated.&nbsp; Many Princes have been.&nbsp; Yet in the Prince
there is danger.&nbsp; One thinks of Dante at the bitter feast <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>in Verona, of
Tasso in Ferrara&rsquo;s madman&rsquo;s cell.&nbsp; It is better
for the artist not to live with Princes.&nbsp; The Pope may be
cultivated.&nbsp; Many Popes have been; the bad Popes have
been.&nbsp; The bad Popes loved Beauty, almost as passionately,
nay, with as much passion as the good Popes hated Thought.&nbsp;
To the wickedness of the Papacy humanity owes much.&nbsp; The
goodness of the Papacy owes a terrible debt to humanity.&nbsp;
Yet, though the Vatican has kept the rhetoric of its thunders,
and lost the rod of its lightning, it is better for the artist
not to live with Popes.&nbsp; It was a Pope who said of Cellini
to a conclave of Cardinals that common laws and common authority
were not made for men such as he; but it was a Pope who thrust
Cellini into prison, and kept him there till he sickened with
rage, and created unreal visions for himself, and saw the gilded
sun enter his room, and grew so enamoured of <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>it that he
sought to escape, and crept out from tower to tower, and falling
through dizzy air at dawn, maimed himself, and was by a
vine-dresser covered with vine leaves, and carried in a cart to
one who, loving beautiful things, had care of him.&nbsp; There is
danger in Popes.&nbsp; And as for the People, what of them and
their authority?&nbsp; Perhaps of them and their authority one
has spoken enough.&nbsp; Their authority is a thing blind, deaf,
hideous, grotesque, tragic, amusing, serious, and obscene.&nbsp;
It is impossible for the artist to live with the People.&nbsp;
All despots bribe.&nbsp; The people bribe and brutalise.&nbsp;
Who told them to exercise authority?&nbsp; They were made to
live, to listen, and to love.&nbsp; Someone has done them a great
wrong.&nbsp; They have marred themselves by imitation of their
inferiors.&nbsp; They have taken the sceptre of the Prince.&nbsp;
How should they use it?&nbsp; They have taken the triple tiara of
the Pope.&nbsp; How should <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>they carry its burden?&nbsp; They are
as a clown whose heart is broken.&nbsp; They are as a priest
whose soul is not yet born.&nbsp; Let all who love Beauty pity
them.&nbsp; Though they themselves love not Beauty, yet let them
pity themselves.&nbsp; Who taught them the trick of tyranny?</p>
<p>There are many other things that one might point out.&nbsp;
One might point out how the Renaissance was great, because it
sought to solve no social problem, and busied itself not about
such things, but suffered the individual to develop freely,
beautifully, and naturally, and so had great and individual
artists, and great and individual men.&nbsp; One might point out
how Louis XIV., by creating the modern state, destroyed the
individualism of the artist, and made things monstrous in their
monotony of repetition, and contemptible in their conformity to
rule, and destroyed throughout all France all those fine freedoms
of expression <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>that had made tradition new in beauty, and new modes one
with antique form.&nbsp; But the past is of no importance.&nbsp;
The present is of no importance.&nbsp; It is with the future that
we have to deal.&nbsp; For the past is what man should not have
been.&nbsp; The present is what man ought not to be.&nbsp; The
future is what artists are.</p>
<p>It will, of course, be said that such a scheme as is set forth
here is quite unpractical, and goes against human nature.&nbsp;
This is perfectly true.&nbsp; It is unpractical, and it goes
against human nature.&nbsp; This is why it is worth carrying out,
and that is why one proposes it.&nbsp; For what is a practical
scheme?&nbsp; A practical scheme is either a scheme that is
already in existence, or a scheme that could be carried out under
existing conditions.&nbsp; But it is exactly the existing
conditions that one objects to; and any scheme that could accept
these conditions is wrong and foolish.&nbsp; The conditions will
be <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>done
away with, and human nature will change.&nbsp; The only thing
that one really knows about human nature is that it
changes.&nbsp; Change is the one quality we can predicate of
it.&nbsp; The systems that fail are those that rely on the
permanency of human nature, and not on its growth and
development.&nbsp; The error of Louis XIV. was that he thought
human nature would always be the same.&nbsp; The result of his
error was the French Revolution.&nbsp; It was an admirable
result.&nbsp; All the results of the mistakes of governments are
quite admirable.</p>
<p>It is to be noted also that Individualism does not come to man
with any sickly cant about duty, which merely means doing what
other people want because they want it; or any hideous cant about
self-sacrifice, which is merely a survival of savage
mutilation.&nbsp; In fact, it does not come to man with any
claims upon him at all.&nbsp; It comes naturally <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>and
inevitably out of man.&nbsp; It is the point to which all
development tends.&nbsp; It is the differentiation to which all
organisms grow.&nbsp; It is the perfection that is inherent in
every mode of life, and towards which every mode of life
quickens.&nbsp; And so Individualism exercises no compulsion over
man.&nbsp; On the contrary, it says to man that he should suffer
no compulsion to be exercised over him.&nbsp; It does not try to
force people to be good.&nbsp; It knows that people are good when
they are let alone.&nbsp; Man will develop Individualism out of
himself.&nbsp; Man is now so developing Individualism.&nbsp; To
ask whether Individualism is practical is like asking whether
Evolution is practical.&nbsp; Evolution is the law of life, and
there is no evolution except towards Individualism.&nbsp; Where
this tendency is not expressed, it is a case of
artificially-arrested growth, or of disease, or of death.</p>
<p>Individualism will also be unselfish <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>and
unaffected.&nbsp; It has been pointed out that one of the results
of the extraordinary tyranny of authority is that words are
absolutely distorted from their proper and simple meaning, and
are used to express the obverse of their right
signification.&nbsp; What is true about Art is true about
Life.&nbsp; A man is called affected, nowadays, if he dresses as
he likes to dress.&nbsp; But in doing that he is acting in a
perfectly natural manner.&nbsp; Affectation, in such matters,
consists in dressing according to the views of one&rsquo;s
neighbour, whose views, as they are the views of the majority,
will probably be extremely stupid.&nbsp; Or a man is called
selfish if he lives in the manner that seems to him most suitable
for the full realisation of his own personality; if, in fact, the
primary aim of his life is self-development.&nbsp; But this is
the way in which everyone should live.&nbsp; Selfishness is not
living as one wishes to live, it is <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>asking others to live as one wishes
to live.&nbsp; And unselfishness is letting other people&rsquo;s
lives alone, not interfering with them.&nbsp; Selfishness always
aims at creating around it an absolute uniformity of type.&nbsp;
Unselfishness recognises infinite variety of type as a delightful
thing, accepts it, acquiesces in it, enjoys it.&nbsp; It is not
selfish to think for oneself.&nbsp; A man who does not think for
himself does not think at all.&nbsp; It is grossly selfish to
require of ones neighbour that he should think in the same way,
and hold the same opinions.&nbsp; Why should he?&nbsp; If he can
think, he will probably think differently.&nbsp; If he cannot
think, it is monstrous to require thought of any kind from
him.&nbsp; A red rose is not selfish because it wants to be a red
rose.&nbsp; It would be horribly selfish if it wanted all the
other flowers in the garden to be both red and roses.&nbsp; Under
Individualism people will be quite natural and absolutely
unselfish, <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>and will know the meanings of the words, and realise
them in their free, beautiful lives.&nbsp; Nor will men be
egotistic as they are now.&nbsp; For the egotist is he who makes
claims upon others, and the Individualist will not desire to do
that.&nbsp; It will not give him pleasure.&nbsp; When man has
realised Individualism, he will also realise sympathy and
exercise it freely and spontaneously.&nbsp; Up to the present man
has hardly cultivated sympathy at all.&nbsp; He has merely
sympathy with pain, and sympathy with pain is not the highest
form of sympathy.&nbsp; All sympathy is fine, but sympathy with
suffering is the least fine mode.&nbsp; It is tainted with
egotism.&nbsp; It is apt to become morbid.&nbsp; There is in it a
certain element of terror for our own safety.&nbsp; We become
afraid that we ourselves might be as the leper or as the blind,
and that no man would have care of us.&nbsp; It is curiously
limiting, too.&nbsp; One should sympathise with <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>the entirety
of life, not with life&rsquo;s sores and maladies merely, but
with life&rsquo;s joy and beauty and energy and health and
freedom.&nbsp; The wider sympathy is, of course, the more
difficult.&nbsp; It requires more unselfishness.&nbsp; Anybody
can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a
very fine nature&mdash;it requires, in fact, the nature of a true
Individualist&mdash;to sympathise with a friend&rsquo;s
success.</p>
<p>In the modern stress of competition and struggle for place,
such sympathy is naturally rare, and is also very much stifled by
the immoral ideal of uniformity of type and conformity to rule
which is so prevalent everywhere, and is perhaps most obnoxious
in England.</p>
<p>Sympathy with pain there will, of course, always be.&nbsp; It
is one of the first instincts of man.&nbsp; The animals which are
individual, the higher animals, that is to say, share it with
us.&nbsp; But it must be remembered that <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>while
sympathy with joy intensifies the sum of joy in the world,
sympathy with pain does not really diminish the amount of
pain.&nbsp; It may make man better able to endure evil, but the
evil remains.&nbsp; Sympathy with consumption does not cure
consumption; that is what Science does.&nbsp; And when Socialism
has solved the problem of poverty, and Science solved the problem
of disease, the area of the sentimentalists will be lessened, and
the sympathy of man will be large, healthy, and
spontaneous.&nbsp; Man will have joy in the contemplation of the
joyous life of others.</p>
<p>For it is through joy that the Individualism of the future
will develop itself.&nbsp; Christ made no attempt to reconstruct
society, and consequently the Individualism that he preached to
man could be realised only through pain or in solitude.&nbsp; The
ideals that we owe to Christ are the ideals of the man who
abandons society entirely, or of the man <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>who resists
society absolutely.&nbsp; But man is naturally social.&nbsp; Even
the Thebaid became peopled at last.&nbsp; And though the cenobite
realises his personality, it is often an impoverished personality
that he so realises.&nbsp; Upon the other hand, the terrible
truth that pain is a mode through which man may realise himself
exercises a wonderful fascination over the world.&nbsp; Shallow
speakers and shallow thinkers in pulpits and on platforms often
talk about the world&rsquo;s worship of pleasure, and whine
against it.&nbsp; But it is rarely in the world&rsquo;s history
that its ideal has been one of joy and beauty.&nbsp; The worship
of pain has far more often dominated the world.&nbsp;
Medi&aelig;valism, with its saints and martyrs, its love of
self-torture, its wild passion for wounding itself, its gashing
with knives, and its whipping with rods&mdash;Medi&aelig;valism
is real Christianity, and the medi&aelig;val Christ is the real
Christ.&nbsp; When the Renaissance dawned upon the world, and
brought <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>with it the new ideals of the beauty of life and the joy
of living, men could not understand Christ.&nbsp; Even Art shows
us that.&nbsp; The painters of the Renaissance drew Christ as a
little boy playing with another boy in a palace or a garden, or
lying back in his mother&rsquo;s arms, smiling at her, or at a
flower, or at a bright bird; or as a noble, stately figure moving
nobly through the world; or as a wonderful figure rising in a
sort of ecstasy from death to life.&nbsp; Even when they drew him
crucified they drew him as a beautiful God on whom evil men had
inflicted suffering.&nbsp; But he did not preoccupy them
much.&nbsp; What delighted them was to paint the men and women
whom they admired, and to show the loveliness of this lovely
earth.&nbsp; They painted many religious pictures&mdash;in fact,
they painted far too many, and the monotony of type and motive is
wearisome, and was bad for art.&nbsp; It was the result of the
authority of the public in art-matters, and is to be
deplored.&nbsp; But <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>their soul was not in the subject.&nbsp; Raphael was a
great artist when he painted his portrait of the Pope.&nbsp; When
he painted his Madonnas and infant Christs, he is not a great
artist at all.&nbsp; Christ had no message for the Renaissance,
which was wonderful because it brought an ideal at variance with
his, and to find the presentation of the real Christ we must go
to medi&aelig;val art.&nbsp; There he is one maimed and marred;
one who is not comely to look on, because Beauty is a joy; one
who is not in fair raiment, because that may be a joy also: he is
a beggar who has a marvellous soul; he is a leper whose soul is
divine; he needs neither property nor health; he is a God
realising his perfection through pain.</p>
<p>The evolution of man is slow.&nbsp; The injustice of men is
great.&nbsp; It was necessary that pain should be put forward as
a mode of self-realisation.&nbsp; Even now, in some places in the
world, the message of Christ is necessary.&nbsp; No one who lived
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>in modern
Russia could possibly realise his perfection except by
pain.&nbsp; A few Russian artists have realised themselves in
Art; in a fiction that is medi&aelig;val in character, because
its dominant note is the realisation of men through
suffering.&nbsp; But for those who are not artists, and to whom
there is no mode of life but the actual life of fact, pain is the
only door to perfection.&nbsp; A Russian who lives happily under
the present system of government in Russia must either believe
that man has no soul, or that, if he has, it is not worth
developing.&nbsp; A Nihilist who rejects all authority, because
he knows authority to be evil, and welcomes all pain, because
through that he realises his personality, is a real
Christian.&nbsp; To him the Christian ideal is a true thing.</p>
<p>And yet, Christ did not revolt against authority.&nbsp; He
accepted the imperial authority of the Roman Empire and paid
tribute.&nbsp; He endured the ecclesiastical authority of the
Jewish <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>Church, and would not repel its violence by any violence
of his own.&nbsp; He had, as I said before, no scheme for the
reconstruction of society.&nbsp; But the modern world has
schemes.&nbsp; It proposes to do away with poverty and the
suffering that it entails.&nbsp; It desires to get rid of pain,
and the suffering that pain entails.&nbsp; It trusts to Socialism
and to Science as its methods.&nbsp; What it aims at is an
Individualism expressing itself through joy.&nbsp; This
Individualism will be larger, fuller, lovelier than any
Individualism has ever been.&nbsp; Pain is not the ultimate mode
of perfection.&nbsp; It is merely provisional and a
protest.&nbsp; It has reference to wrong, unhealthy, unjust
surroundings.&nbsp; When the wrong, and the disease, and the
injustice are removed, it will have no further place.&nbsp; It
will have done its work.&nbsp; It was a great work, but it is
almost over.&nbsp; Its sphere lessens every day.</p>
<p>Nor will man miss it.&nbsp; For what man <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>has sought
for is, indeed, neither pain nor pleasure, but simply Life.&nbsp;
Man has sought to live intensely, fully, perfectly.&nbsp; When he
can do so without exercising restraint on others, or suffering it
ever, and his activities are all pleasurable to him, he will be
saner, healthier, more civilised, more himself.&nbsp; Pleasure is
Nature&rsquo;s test, her sign of approval.&nbsp; When man is
happy, he is in harmony with himself and his environment.&nbsp;
The new Individualism, for whose service Socialism, whether it
wills it or not, is working, will be perfect harmony.&nbsp; It
will be what the Greeks sought for, but could not, except in
Thought, realise completely, because they had slaves, and fed
them; it will be what the Renaissance sought for, but could not
realise completely except in Art, because they had slaves, and
starved them.&nbsp; It will be complete, and through it each man
will attain to his perfection.&nbsp; The new Individualism is the
new Hellenism.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
